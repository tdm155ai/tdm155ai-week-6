# Notebook

[Dictate a note](/dictate) or [transcribe photographs](/transcribe). Both save Markdown documents here, with the newest entries listed first. Edit them like any other Markdown file; new captures never overwrite an existing note.

Dictated notes include a cleaned-up transcript. Photographed notes preserve the writing and mark unclear words; their source photographs appear below the transcription so you can check it.

The Markdown lives in `nextjs/content/notebook/`, and anything else you add there (notes, drafts, sources) is a page too. Audio and raw transcripts stay in `nextjs/_media/dictation/`; photographs and their transcription records stay in `nextjs/_media/notebook/`. Those media folders are local and gitignored.
